    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p class="index">Roanoque Baroque serves as an outreach ministry of St. John Lutheran Church to present
compelling musical performances of high artistic value to the glory of God, bringing together a
diverse range of musicians, audiences, and settings.
        </p>
    <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
        <p class="index">Roanoque Baroque creates a community of musicians who collaborate to form instrumental
and vocal ensembles of various sizes and configurations to perform musical masterpieces from
the Renaissance to Contemporary periods with an emphasis on the music of the 18th century.
Blending professional and dedicated amateur performers, their programs take advantage of
settings of acoustical, architectural, spiritual and cultural significance to connect with a wide
variety of audiences and build an ever-increasing interest in and appreciation for the historic
music of the church and related masterpieces as they demonstrate a witness to the wonder and
beauty of creation. A particular emphasis is made to reach out to young musicians and
audiences, and those with historically less access to the performing arts including, but not
limited to, those who are challenged by hospitalization, incarceration, and mobility and
financial constraints. Both musicians and audience members are drawn into closer
community with the church and the gospel through their interactions.
